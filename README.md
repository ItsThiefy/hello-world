Hello World! I'm new to github!
Hey all, Thiefy here! I am new to github! Im sorta in the middle of a career change and on the journey to be a full time developer. I am taking my C++ certification exam in April and I have some experience with HTML/CSS/javascript and a little bit of Python. I am very excited to create some projects and share them with everyone here! Hope you are having a great day! :)
